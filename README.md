## 👥 Team Project & My Contributions

This repository is a fork of the original team project developed collaboratively by multiple contributors for an academic purpose. My primary responsibilities in the project included:

### Physics Implementation
- Implemented and refined core physics algorithms for gravitational interactions.
- Contributed to the N-body gravitational simulation using Velocity Verlet integration.
- Assisted in developing orbital mechanics, gravitational collapse behavior, and black hole interaction logic.
- Participated in testing and tuning simulation parameters to improve realism and stability.

### Documentation
- Contributed to writing and improving the project documentation.
- Helped prepare technical documentation explaining the simulation architecture, physics methodology, and project workflow.
- Improved project organization and README content for better usability and maintainability.
  
## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Deferred Rendering & HDR Pipeline**: A Multi-Render Target (MRT) framebuffer utilizing 16-bit floating-point textures (`GL_RGBA16F`) to capture high-dynamic-range brightness without color clipping.
*   **Gravitational Lensing**: Screen-space UV distortion post-process pass simulating light bending around the black hole, creating an analytical Einstein Ring.
*   **Accretion Disk Physics**: 30,000 Keplerian orbiting point-sprites colorized dynamically by a black-body temperature approximation (from 10,000K to 40,000K) with inspiral decay.
*   **Tidal Spaghettification**: Real-time non-uniform geometric stretching along the radial axis and lateral compression computed in vertex shaders as planets approach the event horizon.
*   **Dynamic Space-Time Grid**: A deformable mesh in the XZ plane deformed in real-time in the vertex shader based on localized mass density attractors.
*   **Velocity Verlet Integration**: Second-order numerical integration solver simulating N-body gravity during collapse.
*   **18-Phase State Machine**: A complete cosmic lifecycle state machine representing:
    *   *Normal Solar System Orbit* $\rightarrow$ *Approach & N-Body Collapse* $\rightarrow$ *Critical Merge Flash* $\rightarrow$ *Singularity Formation* $\rightarrow$ *Tidal Devouring* $\rightarrow$ *Hawking Evaporation* $\rightarrow$ *Big Bang Rebirth* $\rightarrow$ *Quark-Gluon Plasma* $\rightarrow$ *Dark Ages* $\rightarrow$ *First Stars & Galaxy Formation* $\rightarrow$ *Nebula & Protoplanetary Disk* $\rightarrow$ *New Terraform Earth Rebirth*.
*   **Real-time HUD Controls**: Dear ImGui control panel to configure physics variables, camera modes, post-processing options, and trigger events.
